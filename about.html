    <h1>Project overview</h1>
    <p>
  AlphaSeek is a group project developed by a team of four members.
  Each member had a clearly defined role, covering image processing,
  neural network development, grid solving, and interface design.

      <h2>Tech stack</h2>
      <p>
  The project is fully written in C.
  Image processing and the graphical interface rely on SDL and GTK.
  Character recognition is handled by a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
  with one hidden layer of 64 neurons.
